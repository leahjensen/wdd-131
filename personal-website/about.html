            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                Welcome to my creative corner! Iâ€™m 19 years old and a junior at BYU-Idaho, majoring in Web Design and 
                Development. I grew up in Kingwood, a cozy suburb just outside of Houston, Texas. My journey into web development 
                began with a passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed skills in HTML, 
                CSS, and JavaScript, building projects that blend creativity with user-friendly design. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and 
                creating engaging digital experiences.

                I have a variety of hobbies that bring me joy. I love thrifting and discovering one-of-a-kind clothes or trinkets 
                that have their own unique story. Hanging out with friends and going on adventures is another favorite pastime; whether 
                itâ€™s exploring new places or trying fun activities, I enjoy creating memories with the people I care about. I also love 
                playing video games, with Minecraft, Fortnite, The Sims, and Hogwarts Legacy being some of my top picks. Baking is 
                another passion of mine. I find joy in creating delicious treats from scratch. On quieter days, I love putting on a movie 
                and building LEGO sets.

                Here are some of my favorite projects that I'm proud of. These include a recipe project, a hangman game, and a credit card 
                input. Each project demonstrates my ability to design, code, and bring ideas to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ll 
                also include examples of interactive elements, like menu toggles and JavaScript-powered features, to show how I make websites 
                functional and user-friendly.
