			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Welcome to my corner of the web—a place where coding, creativity, and fun collide! 
                This site is designed for anyone who wants to learn more about my journey, my projects, 
                and what makes me happy.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience for this site includes friends, family, and anyone curious about who I am 
                and what I create. It's perfect for those interested in coding, design, and getting a 
                glimpse into my creative journey. Whether you're here to connect, find inspiration, or

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I think I will use JavaScript to make my site interactive and engaging by adding dynamic 
                elements like a theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes. I’ll also 
                include a personalized greeting that updates based on the time of day and a project 
                showcase section with clickable filters to display different categories of my work.</p>

			<p>Introduction Paragraph:
                I'm Leah, I was born and raised in Houston, Texas.
                My journey into web development started with a simple goal: to create things that are 
                both functional and fun. Over time, this interest grew into a passion for building
